</p>

## Installation:
Our code is implemented in Python 3.8, PyTorch 1.11.0 and CUDA 11.3.
- Install python Dependencies
```bash
conda create -n npull python=3.8
conda activate npull
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=12.1 -c pytorch -c nvidia
pip install tqdm pyhocon==0.3.57 trimesh scipy
pip install pymcubes==0.1.4
```

## Data:
Surface Reconstruction from Point Cloud. 

We provide the demo data in `data/gargoyle.ply`. If you want to reconstruct your own data, please:
- Put your point cloud data on `./data`.
- Note that we support the point cloud data format of `.ply` and `.xyz`.

## Usage:
```python
python run.py --gpu 0 --conf confs/npull.conf --dataname gargoyle --dir gargoyle
```
You can find the generated mesh and the log in `./outs`.
